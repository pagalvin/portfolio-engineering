This checklist captures technical debt and closeout follow-up recommendations that need human review before becoming GitHub issues or scheduled work.

## TD-001

- Title: Phase out the development-only `demoAuth` path after provider-first checks are stable
- Status: accepted
- Severity: medium
- Classification: technical-debt
- Area: auth / frontend / api
- Source: PR #3 (`agents/plan-analysis-first-step`)
- Why it matters: The codebase now supports verified provider callbacks and frontend Google sign-in, so keeping a second development-only session path increases maintenance surface area and can blur which auth path is canonical.
- Suggested next action: Add equivalent provider-driven development checks, then remove `demoAuth` query handling from the frontend and API once local bootstrapping remains simple without it.
- GitHub issue: [#4](https://github.com/pagalvin/portfolio-engineering/issues/4)

## TD-002

- Title: Standardize workspace environment loading across applications
- Status: accepted
- Severity: medium
- Classification: technical-debt
- Area: tooling / configuration
- Source: PR #3 (`agents/plan-analysis-first-step`)
- Why it matters: The API currently loads the workspace `.env` through a custom startup helper while the frontend reads the workspace root through Vite configuration, which can drift over time and make configuration behavior harder to reason about.
- Suggested next action: Define one documented workspace-wide environment loading pattern and align all apps and packages to it.
- GitHub issue: [#5](https://github.com/pagalvin/portfolio-engineering/issues/5)

## TD-003

- Title: Decide whether generated Prisma client code should remain committed
- Status: accepted
- Severity: low
- Classification: technical-debt
- Area: database / build
- Source: PR #3 (`agents/plan-analysis-first-step`)
- Why it matters: Committing generated Prisma client files makes builds reproducible for the current setup, but it also adds large diffs, review noise, and an ongoing maintenance policy decision.
- Suggested next action: Document and confirm whether generated Prisma client code is a permanent committed artifact or should be produced during build and excluded from source control.
- GitHub issue: [#6](https://github.com/pagalvin/portfolio-engineering/issues/6)
